# Changelog

All notable changes to Sunrise will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — see
[`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md) for the public-surface contract and the
release process.

> **Status: `0.x` alpha.** The strict SemVer contract activates at `1.0.0`.
> During `0.x`, forks should expect real merge work between any two releases.
> See [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#0x-alpha-semantics--loose-by-design)
> for what the version commits to (and does not) at this stage.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`AuthBootstrap` Prisma model** (`auth_bootstrap` table) — a singleton marker
  recording that the one-time first-user-is-admin bootstrap has completed.
  Migration `20260531100706_add_auth_bootstrap`. New export: `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ID`
  from `lib/auth/constants.ts`.

### Changed

- **Auth bootstrap — first account on a fresh database becomes `ADMIN`.**
  `userCreateBeforeHook` (`lib/auth/config.ts`) now promotes the first real
  account created on an empty database (email/password **or** OAuth) to the
  `ADMIN` role; every subsequent account is a regular `USER`. The promotion is
  one-time: once the first admin exists, `userCreateAfterHook` writes the
  `AuthBootstrap` marker and the promotion never fires again. The seed unit
  formerly at `prisma/seeds/001-test-users.ts` is renamed to
  `prisma/seeds/001-system-owner.ts` and now provisions a single non-login
  `system@sunrise.local` config-owner (role `ADMIN`, no credential) instead of
  the login-able `admin@example.com` / `test@example.com` users. New export:
  `SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` from `lib/auth/constants.ts`.

### Security

- **Removed the documented-but-nonfunctional default seed credentials.** The
  README previously advertised `admin@example.com` / `test@example.com` with
  `password123`, but the seed never created the better-auth credential records,
  so those logins never worked. Sunrise now ships **zero default login
  credentials**; admin access is bootstrapped by the first-signup rule above.
- **Closed an admin re-bootstrap privilege-escalation window.** The first-user
  promotion is now gated on the persisted `AuthBootstrap` marker (not a live
  user count), and the last-admin self-delete guard in
  `app/api/v1/users/me/route.ts` excludes the non-login `system@sunrise.local`
  owner from its admin count. Together these prevent a scenario where deleting
  the last human admin would return the human count to zero and silently
  promote the next signup to `ADMIN`.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-30

> **Alpha release.** First tagged Sunrise release. Ships in `0.x` per
> [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#0x-alpha-semantics--loose-by-design) —
> forks adopting this release should expect real merge work between any two
> `0.x` releases. The strict SemVer contract activates at `1.0.0`.

The entries below are the fork-readiness pass — the work that makes
Sunrise safe to fork and to merge upstream releases into.

### Added

- **Versioning infrastructure** — `lib/sunrise-version.ts` (`SUNRISE_VERSION`
  constant), `lib/app-version.ts` (`APP_VERSION` — the fork-owned counterpart
  derived from `package.json.version` via a direct import, eliminating the
  brittle `process.env.npm_package_version` detour), `VERSIONING.md`
  (public-surface contract), this `CHANGELOG.md`, and a `sunrise` field on
  the public `/api/health` response so any deployment exposes which Sunrise
  it's running. Includes `lib/validations/monitoring.ts` (Zod schema for
  runtime validation of the health-response shape at the client boundary).
- **Fork-extension seams** (the registries batch) — auto-wired `lib/app/`
  surface for forks to register their own capabilities, admin nav sections,
  rate-limit tiers/rules, and environment variables without touching platform
  code. Includes an ESLint app-boundary that keeps `lib/app/**` portable.
- **GDPR data erasure** — `eraseUser()` service with cascade / `SetNull`
  policies on every `User` FK, a last-admin guard, and an erasure-hook
  registry for app-side residual cleanup that the schema-level cascade can't
  reach (`lib/privacy/erasure-hooks.ts`). The seed of the full data-erasure
  pattern; see [`.context/privacy/data-erasure.md`](./.context/privacy/data-erasure.md).
- **Multi-tenancy playbook** — opt-in playbook with a `TENANCY_MODE`
  environment seam and an inert `lib/tenancy/client.ts` so a fork can retrofit
  Postgres RLS without forking the platform. Sunrise stays single-tenant by
  default. See [`.context/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](./.context/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Public fork-onboarding guide** — `CUSTOMIZATION.md` at repo root, covering
  the app/platform model, the `lib/app/` extension surface, the `package.json`
  dependency/script policy, the database-schema split (your models go in
  `prisma/schema/app.prisma`), and the upstream-sync recipe.
- **Schema-folder split** — Prisma schema split into domain files under
  `prisma/schema/`, with `prisma/schema/app.prisma` reserved for fork-owned
  models. Keeps platform vs app models visually separable on every diff.
- **Migration baseline squash** — 106 dev-history migrations folded into a
  single fork-ready `prisma/migrations/` baseline. Forks adopting this
  release inherit a clean, reviewable migration history rather than the full
  pre-fork churn. See `.context/database/migrations.md` for the reconciliation
  recipe and `npm run db:drift-check` for the drift-detection tooling.
- **Capability quarantine / emergency-disable** — admin orchestration API
  surface for disabling a misbehaving capability without redeploying or
  unbinding it from agents. Includes quarantine-attribution metadata, a
  quarantined-capabilities banner on affected agent pages, and an active-
  quarantines dashboard panel under `/admin/orchestration`. See the
  orchestration admin API reference and `.context/admin/orchestration.md`.
- **Orchestration admin list endpoints — pagination, search, sort** —
  admin list endpoints under `/api/v1/admin/orchestration/**` (agents,
  knowledge documents) now accept paged/search/sorted query parameters,
  with corresponding admin tables wired to use them. Reduces the
  rehydration cost for forks running large agent/knowledge inventories.
- **Agent profiles** — shared persona / voice / guardrails library that
  multiple agents can attach, with override / append composition modes
  resolved at runtime. See `.context/admin/orchestration-agent-profiles.md`
  (admin UI) and `.context/orchestration/agent-profiles.md` (resolver).

### Changed

- **Rate limiting is middleware-driven.** Section caps for `/api/v1/**` are
  enforced by `proxy.ts` via the policy table at
  `lib/security/rate-limit-policy.ts` — new routes inherit the `api` cap
  automatically. Per-flow sub-caps (chat-stream, audio, upload, etc.) remain
  in the handlers. See [`.context/security/rate-limiting.md`](./.context/security/rate-limiting.md).
- **Knowledge-base default seeding is self-healing.** `npm run db:seed`
  re-derives the `kb_default` row when missing rather than failing fast on a
  pre-existing database that's lost the seed — relevant for forks pulling the
  squashed baseline into an existing dev environment.
