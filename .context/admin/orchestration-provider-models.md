# Provider Models admin UI

Admin surface for the `AiProviderModel` registry — the per-model intelligence table (tier classification, reasoning depth, latency, embedding capability) that sits alongside operational `AiProviderConfig` records. For the data model, seed strategy, and library-side selector, see [Provider Selection Matrix](../orchestration/provider-selection-matrix.md).

## Where it lives

```
/admin/orchestration/provider-models           ──307──►  /admin/orchestration/providers?tab=models
/admin/orchestration/provider-models/new       → standalone create page
/admin/orchestration/provider-models/[id]      → standalone edit page
```

The list surface lives as the **Models tab** on the Providers page (`app/admin/orchestration/providers/page.tsx`). The legacy `/provider-models` route redirects there to keep older links working. The matrix table, filters, and decision heuristic all render inside that tab via `<ProviderModelsMatrix />`.

The **new** and **[id]** sub-routes are still standalone server shells — breadcrumb reads `AI Orchestration / Provider Models / New` (or `/ <model.name>`).

## Matrix view

`components/admin/orchestration/provider-models-matrix.tsx` — the client island rendered inside the Models tab.

### Filters

- **Provider** — Radix `<Select>` seeded with distinct `providerSlug` values from the result set, plus "All providers".
- **Tier** — all 6 `TIER_ROLE_META` entries (Thinking, Worker, Infrastructure, Control Plane, Local/Sovereign, Embedding).
- **Capability** — `All` · `Chat` · `Embedding` · `Both`.

### Columns

| Column                                       | Source                                   | Notes                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider                                     | `model.providerSlug`                     | Sortable header                                                                         |
| Name                                         | `model.name`                             | Sortable; links to edit page. `Custom` badge when `!isDefault`                          |
| Tier Role                                    | `model.tierRole`                         | Sortable; rendered via `TIER_ROLE_META[tierRole].label`                                 |
| Capabilities                                 | `model.capabilities[]`                   | Badges: `Chat`, `Embedding`, or `Both`                                                  |
| Reasoning / Latency / Cost / Context / Tools | 5 rating columns                         | All sortable, display enum labels                                                       |
| Configured                                   | derived from matching `AiProviderConfig` | Dot: green = configured + active, yellow = configured + inactive, grey = not configured |

### Sort

Header clicks toggle `sortBy` (one of: `providerSlug`, `name`, `tierRole`, `reasoningDepth`, `latency`, `costEfficiency`, `contextLength`, `toolUse`) and `sortOrder` (`asc` / `desc`). Sort is client-side over the current result set.

### Decision heuristic table

Rendered inline beneath the matrix. Six rows mapping task intent → recommended tier:

| Intent             | Recommended Tier  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `thinking`         | Thinking          |
| `doing`            | Worker            |
| `fast_looping`     | Infrastructure    |
| `high_reliability` | Control Plane     |
| `private`          | Local / Sovereign |
| `embedding`        | Embedding         |

Powered by `GET /api/v1/admin/orchestration/provider-models/recommend?intent=<intent>`, which returns `{ intent, recommendations, heuristic }` — `recommendations` is a scored list of live models in the matching tier.

### "Add model" button

Header action links to `/admin/orchestration/provider-models/new`.

## Form (create & edit)

`components/admin/orchestration/provider-model-form.tsx` — `react-hook-form` + `zodResolver`. Top of the form is a sticky action bar with Cancel / Save.

### Seed-managed warning

The edit page checks `model.isDefault`. When `true`, an amber banner warns:

> This is a seed-managed model — editing it will make it admin-managed.

Any PATCH flips `isDefault` to `false` server-side so re-seeds leave the row alone afterwards.

### Fields

| Field           | Rule                                                                                                                                                |

| Description     | Required, ≤ 2000 chars                                                                                                                              |
| Capabilities    | Two checkboxes: Chat · Embedding. At least one required (enforced client-side before POST)                                                          |
| Tier Role       | Radix `<Select>` populated from `TIER_ROLE_META`; label shows `{label} — {description}`                                                             |
| Reasoning Depth | `very_high` · `high` · `medium` · `none`                                                                                                            |

| Active          | `<Switch>`. Inactive models are hidden from the matrix and `recommend` endpoint                                                                     |

### Embedding-only fields

Rendered in a bordered "Embedding Details" block that only appears when `capEmbedding` is checked:

| Field               | Notes                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dimensions          | Native output vector size (e.g. 1536, 1024, 768)                            |
| Cost / 1M Tokens    | USD, floating point                                                         |
| Schema Compatible   | Checkbox — can the model produce 1536-dim vectors compatible with pgvector? |
| Free Tier           | Checkbox                                                                    |
| Local / Self-hosted | Checkbox                                                                    |
| Quality             | `high` · `medium` · `budget`                                                |
| Strengths           | Free-text description                                                       |
| Setup               | Short setup hint (e.g. "API key → add as provider")                         |

The embedding block feeds the "Compare Embedding Providers" modal on the Knowledge Base page, so fields like Dimensions, Schema Compatible, and Cost are visible to admins comparing embedding options.

### Submit behaviour

- Validation errors surface inline below each field (`errors.{name}.message`).
- The submit handler assembles `capabilities[]` from the two checkboxes and parses numeric strings (`dimensions`, `costPerMillionTokens`) before POST. In create mode, embedding fields are omitted when `capEmbedding` is off. In edit mode, unchecking `capEmbedding` explicitly nulls all embedding fields (`dimensions`, `schemaCompatible`, `costPerMillionTokens`, `hasFreeTier`, `quality`, `strengths`, `setup`) so stale values are cleared from the database.
- Create: `POST /api/v1/admin/orchestration/provider-models` → router pushes to the new model's edit page with a success banner.
- Edit: `PATCH /api/v1/admin/orchestration/provider-models/:id` → inline "Saved" flash for 2s.
- Every non-trivial field has a `<FieldHelp>` popover per the contextual-help rule.

## Recommend endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/admin/orchestration/provider-models/recommend?intent=<intent>
Authorization: Admin
```

`intent` ∈ `thinking` · `doing` · `fast_looping` · `high_reliability` · `private` · `embedding`.

Response:

```jsonc
{
  "intent": "thinking",
  "recommendations": [
    { "slug": "...", "providerSlug": "...", "score": 90, "reason": "..." },
    // ...
  ],
  "heuristic": {
    "thinking": "If it thinks → use frontier models (Tier 1)",
    "doing": "If it does → use cheap/open models (Tier 2)",
    "fast_looping": "If it loops fast → use infra providers (Tier 3)",
    "high_reliability": "If it must not fail → route via aggregators (Tier 4)",
    "private": "If it must stay private → run local (Tier 5)",
    "embedding": "If it needs vector embeddings → use embedding models",
  },
}
```

## Model Audit Workflow

The matrix toolbar includes an **Audit Models** button that triggers the Provider Model Audit workflow — an AI-powered evaluation of model entries for accuracy and freshness.

### What it does

1. Admin selects models to audit via a checkbox dialog (filter by provider, select all/deselect all)
2. On submit, the dialog creates a workflow execution via `POST /workflows/:id/execute` with selected model data as `inputData`
3. The browser redirects to the execution detail page where SSE streaming shows real-time progress
4. The workflow analyses each model's tier classification, capability ratings, and metadata using LLM evaluation
5. A `human_approval` step pauses execution and presents proposed changes for admin review
6. On approval, the `apply_audit_changes` capability writes accepted changes to the database and invalidates the model cache

### Audit frequency

Models evolve quickly but don't need obsessive re-auditing. A reasonable cadence is once every few months, or when you notice a classification inaccuracy (e.g. a model's tier, reasoning depth, or cost rating seems wrong). The audit dialog shows when each model was last audited to help you prioritise.

### Components

| Component         | File                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger dialog    | `components/admin/orchestration/audit-models-dialog.tsx`         |
| Button in matrix  | `components/admin/orchestration/provider-models-matrix.tsx`      |
| Workflow template | `prisma/seeds/data/templates/provider-model-audit.ts`            |
| Capability        | `lib/orchestration/capabilities/built-in/apply-audit-changes.ts` |
| Agent seed        | `prisma/seeds/010-model-auditor.ts`                              |

### Framework reference implementation

This feature also serves as a reference implementation for the orchestration framework, exercising 10 of the 15 step types end-to-end: `llm_call`, `rag_retrieve`, `route`, `parallel`, `guard`, `reflect`, `evaluate`, `human_approval`, `tool_call`, and `send_notification`. FieldHelp annotations in the dialog explain which framework capability each element tests. See [Provider Selection Matrix — Model Audit Workflow](../orchestration/provider-selection-matrix.md#model-audit-workflow) for the full step-type breakdown.
