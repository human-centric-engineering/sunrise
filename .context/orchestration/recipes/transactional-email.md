# Recipe: Transactional Email

Send a single transactional email (booking confirmation, password reset, receipt, escalation summary) via a hosted email provider's REST API. No SDK bundled — the recipe wires `call_external_api` directly against Postmark / SendGrid / Resend / AWS SES REST endpoints.

## 1. When to use this recipe

- Agent needs to send one transactional email at a time, triggered by the conversation (e.g. "email me the summary", "confirm the booking to the guest", "send the escalation report to the on-call inbox")
- One-recipient or small-list (≤10) sends from a single sender identity
- Provider has a JSON REST endpoint that returns a message ID

**Don't use this recipe for:** marketing campaigns, list management, A/B-tested templates, scheduled drip sequences. Those want a marketing-automation tool with its own UI, not an LLM tool call.

## 2. What you ship

- An entry in `ORCHESTRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for the chosen provider
- One env var with the provider's API token
- A binding of `call_external_api` to the agent with the recipe's `customConfig`
- A short addition to the agent's system instructions

No new code, no migrations, no UI changes.

## 3. Allowlist hosts

Add **only** the host(s) for the provider(s) you actually use. Do not blanket-allow vendor domains.

| Vendor         | Add to `ORCHESTRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS`                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Postmark       | `api.postmarkapp.com`                                                 |
| SendGrid       | `api.sendgrid.com`                                                    |
| Resend         | `api.resend.com`                                                      |
| AWS SES (REST) | `email.<region>.amazonaws.com` (e.g. `email.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`) |

## 4. Credential setup

| Vendor         | Env var (name is your choice; the binding references it) | Value format                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Postmark       | `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`                                  | Server token from Postmark → Servers → API Tokens                                                              |
| SendGrid       | `SENDGRID_API_KEY`                                       | API key with `mail.send` scope only — do not use a full-access key                                             |
| Resend         | `RESEND_API_KEY`                                         | API key from Resend dashboard                                                                                  |
| AWS SES (REST) | `AWS_SES_BASIC`                                          | Either pre-signed SigV4 credentials (advanced) or use SES SMTP creds via Basic auth: `<smtp-user>:<smtp-pass>` |

Set the var in `.env.local` for dev and through your secret manager in prod. The binding references the **env var name**, never the value.

## 5. Capability binding

Worked example: Postmark. Save this as the `customConfig` on the `AiAgentCapability` row.

```json
{
  "allowedUrlPrefixes": ["https://api.postmarkapp.com/email"],
  "auth": {
    "type": "api-key",
    "secret": "POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN",
    "apiKeyHeaderName": "X-Postmark-Server-Token"
  },
  "forcedHeaders": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  },
  "defaultResponseTransform": {
    "type": "jmespath",
    "expression": "{messageId: MessageID, to: To, errorCode: ErrorCode}"
  },
  "timeoutMs": 15000,
  "maxResponseBytes": 32768
}
```

Postmark uses `X-Postmark-Server-Token` (rather than the generic `X-API-Key`) for authentication. The `apiKeyHeaderName` field on the auth config tells the api-key path to use that header name instead of the default — the secret stays in env vars, never in DB. For providers that use `Authorization: Bearer ...` (SendGrid, Resend), use `auth.type: 'bearer'` and remove the `apiKeyHeaderName` line — see [Vendor variants](#8-vendor-variants).

## 6. Agent prompt guidance

Append to the agent's system instructions:

```
You can send transactional emails via the `call_external_api` tool. To send an email, call the tool with:
  - url: https://api.postmarkapp.com/email
  - method: POST
  - body: { "From": "<your verified sender>", "To": "<recipient>", "Subject": "<subject>", "TextBody": "<plain text>", "HtmlBody": "<optional html>" }

Only send emails when the user has clearly asked for one or when the conversation policy explicitly authorises it. Confirm the recipient address before sending. After sending, tell the user the email has been sent and quote the messageId from the response.
```

Adjust the policy guardrails to match your deployment — most pilots want explicit user confirmation before any email leaves.

## 7. Worked example

User: _"Please email me a summary of this conversation. My address is alice@example.com."_

Agent decides to call the tool. The LLM emits:

```json
{
  "tool": "call_external_api",
  "args": {
    "url": "https://api.postmarkapp.com/email",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": {
      "From": "agent@yourcompany.com",
      "To": "alice@example.com",
      "Subject": "Conversation summary",
      "TextBody": "Here is the summary you requested:\n\n…"
    }
  }
}
```

Capability dispatcher merges the binding's `customConfig`, builds the request:

```http
POST /email HTTP/1.1
Host: api.postmarkapp.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
X-Postmark-Server-Token: <resolved from POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN>

{"From":"agent@yourcompany.com","To":"alice@example.com","Subject":"Conversation summary","TextBody":"Here is the summary you requested:\n\n…"}
```

Postmark response (200):

```json
{
  "To": "alice@example.com",
  "SubmittedAt": "2026-05-02T10:34:21.123Z",
  "MessageID": "abc-123-def",
  "ErrorCode": 0,
  "Message": "OK"
}
```

After the binding's `defaultResponseTransform` runs, the LLM sees:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "body": { "messageId": "abc-123-def", "to": "alice@example.com", "errorCode": 0 }
}
```

The agent replies: _"I've sent the summary to alice@example.com (message ID `abc-123-def`)."_

## 8. Vendor variants

### SendGrid

```json
{
  "allowedUrlPrefixes": ["https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send"],
  "auth": { "type": "bearer", "secret": "SENDGRID_API_KEY" },
  "forcedHeaders": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  "defaultResponseTransform": { "type": "template", "expression": "messageId: {{x-message-id}}" },
  "timeoutMs": 15000,
  "maxResponseBytes": 4096
}
```

Body shape changes — SendGrid uses `personalizations`, `from`, `subject`, `content[]`. SendGrid returns 202 with no JSON body and the message ID in the `x-message-id` header; the response transform extracts it.

### Resend

```json
{
  "allowedUrlPrefixes": ["https://api.resend.com/emails"],
  "auth": { "type": "bearer", "secret": "RESEND_API_KEY" },
  "defaultResponseTransform": { "type": "jmespath", "expression": "id" },
  "timeoutMs": 15000,
  "maxResponseBytes": 4096
}
```

Body: `{ "from": "...", "to": ["..."], "subject": "...", "html": "..." }`. Returns `{ id: "..." }`.

### AWS SES (REST)

```json
{
  "allowedUrlPrefixes": ["https://email.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v2/email/outbound-emails"],
  "auth": { "type": "basic", "secret": "AWS_SES_BASIC" },
  "timeoutMs": 15000,
  "maxResponseBytes": 4096
}
```

Body shape follows the SES v2 API. Auth via SES SMTP credentials in Basic format — for full SigV4 use a sidecar signing proxy or migrate to a dedicated `AwsSesCapability` (out of recipe scope).

## 9. Common variants

- **HTML + plain-text together.** Always include both `TextBody` and `HtmlBody` (Postmark) / `text` and `html` (SendGrid, Resend). Improves deliverability and is required for some clients
- **CC / BCC.** Most providers accept comma-separated `Cc` / `Bcc` strings. Cap the count at 10 to stay inside the recipe's small-list scope
- **Attachments.** Inline base64 attachments work for sub-100KB files (Postmark `Attachments`, SendGrid `attachments`). For larger attachments, upload to object storage first and link to a download URL — the LLM-bound tool call should not handle large binary payloads
- **Templated emails.** Postmark templates (`/email/withTemplate`), SendGrid Dynamic Templates, and Resend templates are all another POST endpoint with a different `allowedUrlPrefixes` value. Bind a separate `call_external_api` instance if you want both transactional and templated paths

## 10. Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Putting the API key in `body` or `headers` from the LLM args.** Use `customConfig.auth` so the LLM never sees the secret. Anything in `args` is visible in the conversation transcript and trace
- ❌ **Skipping the `allowedUrlPrefixes` guard.** Without it, the LLM could POST to `/server/<id>` (admin endpoints) on the same host. Always set it
- ❌ **Letting the LLM choose the `From:` address freely.** Hardcode it via `forcedHeaders` or a `body` template at binding time. Otherwise the agent can spoof any sender
- ❌ **Sending the same message twice on retries.** Email APIs are not natively idempotent. If you set the workflow / chat handler to retry on transient failures, attach an `idempotencyKey` (only Resend honours it; for others, deduplicate at your application layer)
- ❌ **No rate limit consideration.** Postmark allows 300/sec, SendGrid 600/sec — but a chatty agent looping over a list will hit it. Use the global outbound rate limiter (`ORCHESTRATION_OUTBOUND_RATE_LIMIT`) to cap

## 11. Test plan

1. Set `ORCHESTRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.postmarkapp.com` in `.env.local`
2. Set `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=<your sandbox token>` (Postmark provides a sandbox server that returns success responses without delivering)
3. Bind `call_external_api` to a test agent with the binding from §5
4. Update the agent's system instructions per §6
5. Open a chat with the agent: _"Send a test email to test@example.com"_
6. **Verify:**
   - The agent's response includes a Postmark message ID
   - The trace viewer shows the tool call with `body` → `{From, To, Subject, TextBody}`
   - The trace viewer shows the response with `MessageID`
   - **The trace viewer does NOT show the API token anywhere** — neither in `args`, in `headers`, nor in the response. The token is resolved server-side and stripped from logs
7. **Negative tests:** ask the agent to send to an obviously invalid address, ask it to POST to `/server/123` (should be blocked by `allowedUrlPrefixes`), set `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=` to empty and confirm the call fails with `auth_failed` rather than sending unauthenticated
