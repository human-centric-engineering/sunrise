# NPM Configuration for Sunrise

# Use legacy peer dependency resolution
# Required due to better-auth@1.4.7 expecting @prisma/client@^5.22.0
# while we're using @prisma/client@7.1.0
#
# Context:
# - better-auth 1.4.7 has peerOptional dependency on @prisma/client ^5.22.0
# - We're using Prisma 7.1.0 for latest features and fixes
# - better-auth works correctly with Prisma 7 in practice
# - This flag allows npm to proceed despite the version mismatch
#
# TODO: Remove this once better-auth officially supports Prisma 7
# Track: https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues (check for Prisma 7 support)
