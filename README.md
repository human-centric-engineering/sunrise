# Sunrise 🌅

A production-ready Next.js starter template designed for rapid application development with AI assistance.

## What is Sunrise?

Sunrise is a modern full-stack starter that gets you from zero to production-ready application in minutes, not days. Built with best practices baked in, it's optimized for both human developers and AI-assisted development workflows.

## Why Sunrise?

Most starter templates are either too minimal (just a scaffold) or too opinionated (locked into specific patterns). Sunrise strikes the balance: comprehensive yet customizable, production-ready yet approachable.

**Built for:**
- Teams shipping MVPs quickly
- Solo developers who want to focus on features, not infrastructure
- Projects that need production-grade auth, database, and APIs from day one
- AI-assisted development (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

## Tech Stack

**Core:**
- Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- NextAuth.js v5 for authentication
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components

**Production Ready:**
- Docker containerization
- Email with Resend + React Email
- Zod validation throughout
- Security headers, rate limiting, CORS
- Comprehensive API layer

## Project Status

🚧 **Under Development** - Currently implementing the core foundation. See [`.instructions/SUNRISE-BUILD-PLAN.md`](./.instructions/SUNRISE-BUILD-PLAN.md) for the complete build roadmap.

## Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Quick reference for AI-assisted development
- **[.context/substrate.md](./.context/substrate.md)** - Comprehensive architecture and implementation docs
- **[Build Plan](./.instructions/SUNRISE-BUILD-PLAN.md)** - Detailed implementation roadmap

## Philosophy

1. **Production-First** - Security, performance, and reliability are not afterthoughts
2. **Type-Safe** - TypeScript strict mode everywhere, Zod for runtime validation
3. **Well-Documented** - Code is temporary, decisions are permanent
4. **AI-Optimized** - Structured for AI code generation while remaining human-readable
5. **Fork-Friendly** - Take what you need, customize what you want

## Quick Start

*(Coming soon - setup instructions will be added once core features are implemented)*
